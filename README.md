Rock Vs Mine Prediction Machine Learning Model


In this project, I, Zulqarnain (Zulqai), developed a machine learning model that predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine. This classification task is based on sonar signal data, where each instance contains 60 numerical features representing sound wave frequencies bounced off underwater objects.

Using Python and the scikit-learn library, I trained and evaluated different classification algorithms including:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest

After evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, I selected the best-performing algorithm for final deployment.

The data preprocessing steps included:

Handling missing values

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

This project helped me sharpen my skills in data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and real-world application of machine learning. It‚Äôs a great example of how AI can be used in underwater exploration and defense systems.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas & NumPy

scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

This is one of many projects I, Zulqarnain, am building as part of my journey to become a top AI & Machine Learning Engineer. Stay tuned‚Äîmore projects coming soon!
